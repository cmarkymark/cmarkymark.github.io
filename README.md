Hello, my name is Charles Marks.  I am a doctoral student in the [IRSU JDP @ SDSU-UCSD](irsu.sdsu.edu).  I'm trying to navigate how to be an anarchist activist and an academic at the same time.  Someone I had the pleasure of learning from told me that one cannot make changes to a broken system from the inside -- I understand this to be true.  But academia, while certainly an institution in need of greater reform, seems a bit different in the sense that researchers and often empowered to create new institutions.  

Basically, here I want to host my work in a space that I have control over and where I can make my work free to access.  I do a fair bit of data analysis and I would like to be transparent in reporting my methods and results, so that will all be hosted here.

I will update this, but for now, figured I'd put a placeholder in (1/21/19)
