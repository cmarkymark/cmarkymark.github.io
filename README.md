# About

Hello, my name is Charles Marks (they/them), MPH ('17).  I am currently a doctoral student in the [IRSU JDP @ SDSU-UCSD](https://chhs.sdsu.edu/irsu/).  As a part of this program, I work on research teams both at SDSU and UCSD and I am teaching within the SDSU School of Social Work.  I have a background in maths and computer science, which has put me in a decent position to become a statistican and data scientist.  I approach my work from a critical social lens, with a particular interest in the role power structures reinforce inequities and disparities.  As a primarily quantitative research, I currently hold a great interest in applying statistical techniques in alignment with this critical lens.  Of particular interest, my dissertation shall focus on the role which trauma and adversity play within the substance use life course.
