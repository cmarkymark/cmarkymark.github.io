## Charles Marks, MPH

I (they/them) am a doctoral student in the Interdisciplinary Research on Substance Use Joint Doctoral Program at San Diego State University and University of California, San Diego.  I apply a naturalist, critical social lens to addressing issues of health equity.  With a mathematics background, I also seek to apply statistics and modeling methods 

## Education

### Oberlin College '14, BA (Mathematics & Computer Science)

Studies primarily focused in theoretical computer science, with a particular focus on both graph theory and complexity theory (with a sort of haphazard forray into [Math art](http://bridgesmathart.org/2012/cdrom/exhibition.pdf).  

### University of Southern California '17, MPH

Focus was on health promotion and education with a particular interest in the application of critical social theories to address health inequities.

Thesis : [Substance Criminalization, Mass Incarceration, & Disenfranchisement](https://cmarkymark.github.io/papers/Substance%20Criminalization%2C%20Mass%20Incarceration%2C%20%26%20Disenfranchisement.pdf)

### San Diego State University & University of California San Diego '21, PhD

Current doctoral student in the [Joint Doctoral Program in Interdisciplinary Research on Substance Use @ SDSU-UCSD](https://chhs.sdsu.edu/irsu/). 

Advisor: Dan Werb

Dissertation Committee Members: Dan Werb, Natasha Martin, Laramie Smith, Maria Luisa Zuniga, Lianne Urada, Salvador Espinosa

## Job Appointments

### Toiyabe Indian Health Project: Family Services Intern

Worked in the department of Family Services doing data analysis and general program assistance.

### Graduate Assistant: SDSU School of Social Work (2017 - Current)

Primary responsibility as teaching assistant in the fall of 2019 and instructor of record in the Spring of 2020.  Course TBD.

### Researcher: [PRIMER](https://primerstudy.com/our-team/) (2017 - Current)

Pre-doctoral researcher on the PRIMER study.  Responsibilities have included data analysis, manuscript production, and general assistance with other project tasks (website editing, grant assistance).

### Data Analyst: [SAFE-D](https://www.vtti.vt.edu/utc/safe-d/index.php/projects/big-data-visualization-and-spatiotemporal-modeling-of-aggressive-driving/) (2018 - 2019)

Project goal is to identify aggressive driving from unlabeled real-world driving data.  Utilized both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to classify and label large datasets and developed tools for visualizing this data.  All analyses conducted in R on top of a PostGreSQL server.
