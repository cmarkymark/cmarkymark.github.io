## Charles Marks, MPH

I (they/them) am a doctoral student in the Interdisciplinary Research on Substance Use Joint Doctoral Program at San Diego State University and University of California, San Diego.  I apply a naturalist, critical social lens to addressing issues of health equity.  With a mathematics background, I also seek to apply statistics and modeling methods 

## Education

### Oberlin College '14, BA (Mathematics & Computer Science)

Studies primarily focused in theoretical computer science, with a particular focus on both graph theory and complexity theory (with a sort of haphazard forray into [Math art](http://bridgesmathart.org/2012/cdrom/exhibition.pdf).  

### University of Southern California '17, MPH

Focus was on health promotion and education with a particular interest in the application of critical social theories to address health inequities.
