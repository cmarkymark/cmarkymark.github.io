### Annotated Bibliography

I wanted to create a space where I can reflect on papers.  While I am pretty early stage in this academia thing, I already sense I have lost quite a bit of the memorty of my first publications and it seems wise to create a living document of this type.
Now, I am not sure exactly if you will find this particularly useful, but I feel (currently starting this as a 3rd year doctoral student), that I don't really know what academic trajectories look like, even when I am surrounded by academics.
In fact, I feel, so far, I have presented myself as being far more knowledgable than I truly am and I think this also can be a good space ot articulate how messy a lot of this work felt in the moment (which I think is a privilege I can only undertake now with a few publications under my belt and the assumption that few people will take a gander at this page at all).

These are presented in chronological order for which they were accepted for publication, though not necessarily reflective of the actual publication date: 

**Marks, C.**, Zúñiga, M.L., Identifying Key Subpopulations Among HIV+ Latinos Receiving Care in San Diego-Tijuana & Assessing CAM Utilization and ARV Adherence: A Latent Class Analysis. Frontiers in Public Health [DOI: 10.3389/fpubh.2019.00179](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00179)

I initially wrote this in the first year of my doctoral program for a multivariate statistics class.  The director of our program, Dr. Zuniga, had been sitting on the data for a while and was kind enough to allow us to use it for the class.  I have a background in computer science and math (not statistics), so this made adopting R fairly straightforward, though I admit my understanding of statistical concepts was rather limited.  I have noticed whenever I have learned something new (usually from making mistakes), it is then really easy to act like you're an expert (even when you just learned that thing like a few days prior).  Anyway, Dr. Zuniga's study focused on Complementary and Alternative Medicine and medication adherence among HIV+ Latinos in the border region.  The general idea was to use a latent class analysis to divide population based on membership in three high-risk HIV groups: people who inject; men who have sex with men; and those who have traded sex.  I believe this was actually the initial idea we landed upon and this analysis made it into the published paper without edit (I will continue to look, but I regret that I am unsure where I saved the R Code...I did the first year of my program using public computers and a chromebook....)  As was noted by another program director, this approach of dividing the population based on membership in these three groups might be seen as arbitrary, for we could have chosen other factors (such as income or nationality) which likely would've bore similar results, but I think the big takeaway I took from this work was that the explanation for your choice in methods are an integral part of the analysis as a whole.  This is social science statistics, there are inherent flaws with every analysis, it's not just our job to run the analysis, but to convince the reader the analysis is meaningful.
