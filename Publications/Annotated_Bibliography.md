### Annotated Bibliography

I wanted to create a space where I can reflect on papers.  While I am pretty early stage in this academia thing, I already sense I have lost quite a bit of the memorty of my first publications and it seems wise to create a living document of this type.
Now, I am not sure exactly if you will find this particularly useful, but I feel (currently starting this as a 3rd year doctoral student), that I don't really know what academic trajectories look like, even when I am surrounded by academics.
In fact, I feel, so far, I have presented myself as being far more knowledgable than I truly am and I think this also can be a good space ot articulate how messy a lot of this work felt in the moment (which I think is a privilege I can only undertake now with a few publications under my belt and the assumption that few people will take a gander at this page at all).
