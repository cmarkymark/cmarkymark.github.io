On this page you will be able to access R Code associated with various projects which I have been a part of.  Unless otherwhise noted, all of the code was written by me in their entirety.  You are welcome to copy, fork, any code, whatever you wanna do.  Crediting where you got the code is appreciated (i.e. if you publish something, cite the paper you forked the code from).  

I also note for publications the original output is not available (and the reasons why) but where I have done my best to replicate the code used.  With my first publications, I was not accoustomed to the actual reality of my work being published -- I believe firmly that all statistical analyses should be made open source, and so I shall do my best to abide by and embody those principles.

For the first two years of my doctoral program I used a chromebook and had to do my analysis on a semi-public computer (in a shared TA office).  I need to check if the code is still on that machine.  I will include an R script soon, if I cannot find it, with the commands used to undertake the analysis.  Due to the sensitive nature of the data, I am not permitted to share the underlying data source. (12/31/19)

The code is available as an rMarkdown file, but due to patient privacy, I am not permitted to provide the actual dataset.  Access the code by clicking [here](Code/Baxter_AJO_Final_Analysis.Rmd)

The code used to undertake this study is available [here](Code/Marks_PlosMED_Code.R).  The paper may be read in full to learn more about the methods and how the model was parameterized.
